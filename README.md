### Dear visitor!

You gonna see me building a few charts from this data set 
(https://www.berlin.de/ba-charlottenburg-wilmersdorf/verwaltung/aemter/umwelt-und-naturschutz/umweltschutz/reparaturfuehrer/index.php/index/all.json?q=).
It's about places in Berlin Charlottenburg-Wilmersdorf, where you can repair your broken stuff. 

According to the motto **'Repair instead of throwing away'**.

### I'm working with chart.js (react), bulma and next.js

Let's see what the district has to offer!
